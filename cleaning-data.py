# For this project, I needed to combine data from the FEC dataset (campaign finance) and MEDSL datasets (election results). Because of small discrepancies 
# in how candidates' names were entered into the dataset, I used both the pandas library in python and Google Sheets functionality to combine the datasets.
# The Google Sheets functionality is difficult to document, but a quick explanation would be that I split the candidates' names into three columns: first name,
# last name, and middle initial. The rest is done in the following python code.
# Note: The cleaned datasets used in finding-relationships.py are also uploaded into this repository for ease of access.
